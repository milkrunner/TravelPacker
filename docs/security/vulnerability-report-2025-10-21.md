## Detailed Vulnerability Analysis

### ✅ RESOLVED: PYSEC-2022-43012 (setuptools)

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Package:** setuptools  
**Affected Version:** 65.5.0  
**Fixed Version:** 80.9.0 (installed)

**Vulnerability Details:**

- **Type:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
- **Location:** package_index.py
- **Impact:** DoS via crafted HTML in package metadata
- **CVSS Score:** 5.5 (MEDIUM)

**Attack Vector:**
An attacker could craft malicious HTML in a package or custom PackageIndex page, causing excessive CPU usage through regex backtracking.

**Remediation:**
Upgraded to setuptools 80.9.0, which includes the regex fix.

**Verification:**

```bash
$ python -c "import setuptools; print(setuptools.__version__)"
80.9.0  ✅
```

---

### ✅ RESOLVED: PYSEC-2025-49 (setuptools)

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Package:** setuptools  
**Affected Version:** 65.5.0  
**Fixed Version:** 80.9.0 (installed)

**Vulnerability Details:**

- **Type:** Path Traversal
- **Location:** PackageIndex
- **Impact:** Arbitrary file write → Potential RCE
- **CVSS Score:** 7.5 (HIGH)

**Attack Vector:**
A malicious package could escape the extraction directory and write files to arbitrary filesystem locations with the permissions of the Python process.

**Exploitation Scenario:**

1. Attacker creates malicious package with path traversal sequences
2. User installs package: `pip install malicious-package`
3. setuptools extracts files outside intended directory
4. Attacker overwrites system files (e.g., ~/.bashrc, startup scripts)
5. Code execution on next login/restart

**Remediation:**
Upgraded to setuptools 80.9.0, which validates extraction paths.

**Verification:**

```bash
$ pip-audit | grep setuptools
# No output - setuptools vulnerabilities resolved ✅
```

### ⏳ PENDING: GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph (pip)

**Status:** ⏳ AWAITING FIX  
**Package:** pip  
**Current Version:** 25.2  
**Fix Version:** 25.3 (not yet released)

**Vulnerability Details:**

- **Type:** Path Traversal in tarfile extraction
- **Location:** Fallback sdist extraction path
- **Impact:** Arbitrary file overwrite
- **CVSS Score:** 7.3 (HIGH)
- **GitHub Advisory:** GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph

**Attack Vector:**
When installing a source distribution (sdist), pip's fallback extraction code doesn't validate symbolic/hard link targets. A malicious sdist can include links that escape the extraction directory.

**Exploitation Conditions:**

1. User installs package from untrusted source
2. Package is distributed as sdist (source distribution)
3. Fallback extraction path is triggered
4. Malicious symlinks escape extraction directory

**Example Attack:**

```python
# Malicious package structure
malicious-package/
├── setup.py
└── data/
    └── evil_symlink -> /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**Current Mitigation:**
✅ **Risk Assessment: LOW**

**Why risk is low:**

1. **Trusted Sources Only:** Application only installs from PyPI (trusted)
2. **No User-Controlled Installs:** Production doesn't install arbitrary packages
3. **Fallback Path Rare:** Modern sdists rarely trigger fallback extraction
4. **PEP 706 Defense:** Python 3.11+ provides additional protection

**Active Mitigations:**

- ✅ Only install packages from PyPI (verified publishers)
- ✅ Pin versions in requirements.txt (no automatic installs)
- ✅ Docker container isolation (limited blast radius)
- ✅ Non-root container user (limited permissions)

**Monitoring:**

- ✅ Track pip 25.3 release: <https://github.com/pypa/pip/releases>
- ✅ GitHub Actions will auto-detect when fix is available
- ✅ Weekly scans ensure timely upgrade

**Remediation Plan:**

```bash
# When pip 25.3 is released:
pip install --upgrade pip>=25.3
pip-audit  # Verify fix
git commit -m "Security: Upgrade pip to 25.3 (fix GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph)"
```

**Accepted Risk:**
✅ **Documented and Accepted**

- Risk Level: LOW (with mitigations)
- Owner: Development Team
- Review Date: Weekly until pip 25.3 release
- Escalation: Immediate upgrade when available
