# Security Enhancement: Dependency Scanning

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**Priority:** HIGH

---

## Enhancement Overview

Implemented automated dependency scanning using `pip-audit` to continuously monitor Python dependencies for known security vulnerabilities. This provides early warning of security issues in third-party packages before they can be exploited.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. pip-audit Integration ✅

- **Added:** `pip-audit==2.6.1` to `requirements.txt`
- **Database:** OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities) and PyPI Advisory Database
- **Coverage:** All direct and transitive dependencies

### 2. Local Scanning Scripts ✅

#### Windows PowerShell Script

- **File:** `scripts/scan_dependencies.ps1`
- **Features:**
  - Auto-install pip-audit if missing
  - Multiple output formats (text, JSON)
  - Auto-fix mode (`-Fix` flag)
  - Strict mode (`-Strict` flag)
  - Color-coded output

**Usage:**

```powershell
# Basic scan
.\scripts\scan_dependencies.ps1

# Install and scan
.\scripts\scan_dependencies.ps1 -Install

# Auto-fix vulnerabilities
.\scripts\scan_dependencies.ps1 -Fix

# Generate JSON report
.\scripts\scan_dependencies.ps1 -Json
```

#### Linux/Mac Bash Script

- **File:** `scripts/scan_dependencies.sh`
- **Same features as PowerShell version**

**Usage:**

```bash
chmod +x scripts/scan_dependencies.sh
./scripts/scan_dependencies.sh --install
./scripts/scan_dependencies.sh --fix
```

### 3. GitHub Actions CI/CD ✅

- **File:** `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`
- **Triggers:**
  - Every push to main/master
  - Every pull request
  - Weekly schedule (Monday 9 AM UTC)
  - Manual dispatch

**Actions:**

- Scans all dependencies
- Generates JSON and human-readable reports
- Uploads artifacts (30-day retention)
- Fails build on critical vulnerabilities

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation ✅

- **File:** `docs/DEPENDENCY_SCANNING.md` (1,500+ lines)
- **Contents:**
  - Installation and usage guide
  - Remediation strategies
  - CI/CD integration
  - Best practices
  - Troubleshooting
  - Compliance reporting

4. Test application after upgrade
5. Commit updated requirements.txt

### Issue: Can't upgrade due to breaking changes

**Action:**

1. Document vulnerability: `# package==1.0  # VULN-123: Risk accepted`
2. Create remediation ticket
3. Plan upgrade in next sprint
4. Monitor for exploits

### Issue: False positives

**Action:**

1. Verify vulnerability applies to your usage
2. Document decision: Add comment in requirements.txt
