# NikNotes - AI-Powered Trip Packing Assistant ⚡

Never forget what to pack again! NikNotes is your intelligent travel companion that helps you remember everything you need for your trips.

**🚀 BLAZING FAST**: PostgreSQL + Redis caching for lightning-fast AI suggestions (10-50ms response times!)

## Features

### 🎒 Smart Packing Lists

Keep track of all the items you need to bring on your trip with organized, customizable packing lists.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Suggestions (with Caching!)

Get intelligent recommendations for what to pack based on:

- Your destination
- Trip duration

## Getting Started

### Quick Setup

**🐳 Docker (Recommended for Production):**

```bash
# Set your Gemini API key in .env file or environment
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# Generate and set a secure Flask secret key
export FLASK_SECRET_KEY=$(python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))")

# Start all services (PostgreSQL + Redis + Web App)
docker compose up -d

# Open: http://localhost:5000
```

**Note:** PostgreSQL performance settings are configured in `docker-compose.yml` at container startup. No manual configuration needed!

See [docs/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed Docker instructions.

**⚡ Automated Setup Scripts:**

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
.\setup_performance.ps1
```

**Linux/Debian/Ubuntu (Bash):**

```bash
chmod +x setup_performance.sh
./setup_performance.sh
```

These scripts will automatically install PostgreSQL, Redis, create the database, and configure everything! ⚡

For manual setup or troubleshooting, see [Performance Guide](docs/architecture/performance.md).
